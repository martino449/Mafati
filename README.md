## Stack Interpreter
This program implements a Stack class that interprets and executes a custom scripting language. It supports variables, functions, conditional statements, and library loading, allowing for dynamic code execution and manipulation.

### Features:
Dynamic Variable Management: Define and manipulate variables, including constants that cannot be modified once set.
Function Definitions: Create reusable functions with a simple syntax and execute them within the interpreter.
Library Support: Load external libraries to extend functionality and add new capabilities.
Conditional Logic: Implement if and else statements to control the flow of execution based on variable values.
Safe Expression Evaluation: Evaluate mathematical expressions and support basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power).
Debugging Tools: Access debug information for troubleshooting and understanding program state.
How It Works:
The interpreter reads lines of code from a specified file, processes each line, and executes the corresponding actions. The stack size is adjustable, and the interpreter ensures that operations remain within defined limits.

This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful platform for experimenting with programming concepts and exploring the design of interpreters.
